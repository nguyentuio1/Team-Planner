# Guideline  
## NAVER Vietnam AI Hackathon – Preliminary Assignment  
### Development of a "Smart To-Do App"

---

## 🎯 Assignment Overview  
Please develop an intelligent to-do management app for Vietnamese college students.  
It's not just a notepad for writing down "to-dos," but a tool that truly manages academics and daily life.  
Level up — we are looking forward to a smart app that can do that!  

There are no restrictions on the format of the to-do app. Please create it in various concepts such as:  
- Memo type  
- Calendar type  
- Drag-and-drop type  
- Or other creative concepts

## 📋 Essential Feature Requirements  
- **CRUD functions**: Create, view, edit, and delete tasks  
- **Category classification**: At least 3 categories (e.g., academic, extracurricular, personal)  
- **Prioritization**: 3 levels — high, medium, low  
- **Set a deadline**: Date/time-based deadline management
